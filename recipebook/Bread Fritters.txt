Ingredients
10 leftover bread slices
1/4 cup curds (dahi)
1/2 cup grated carrot
1/2 cup besan (Bengal gram flour)
1 tsp green chilli paste
2 tbsp chopped coriander
Salt to taste
Oil for greasing & deep-frying
Green chutney & Tomato ketchup 
 

Steps
Remove the crust of the bread slices and crumble them into small pieces with your fingers and put them in a deep bowl.
Add the curds and mix very well using your fingers.
Add the carrot, besan, green chilli paste, coriander and salt and mix well.
Add approx. 1/4 cup of water and mix well or till the mixture binds well.
Divide the mixture into 16 equal portions.
Grease your palms with a little oil and shape a portion into a round ball in between your palms. Press it lightly in the centre to form a slight depression and put in hot oil in a deep non-stick kadhai.
Shape 3 more portions and put them in the oil and deep-fry all 4 at a time in a batch on a medium flame till they turn golden brown in colour from all the sides.
Repeat step 6 to make 12 more balls in 3 more batches. Drain on an absorbent paper and keep aside. Serve immediately with green chutney and tomato ketchup.
