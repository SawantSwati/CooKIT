HOW TO MAKE THE BEST TOMATO BASIL SOUP


Sauté aromatics. Heat oil in a large pot or Dutch oven for 2 minutes over medium-high heat until the hot oil is shimmering hot. Add onion and garlic. Sauté until tender, about 3-4 minutes.
Add ingredients. Add fresh tomatoes, tomato sauce, and basil. Stir in the remaining seasoning (Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper). Reduce heat to medium and cook until tomatoes soften, about 6-8 minutes
Add broth and simmer. Pour in broth, cover the lid, and turn the heat down to low. Allow the soup to simmer over low heat for 5 minutes.
Puree the soup. Turn off the heat and puree the soup. For a smoother texture, transfer the soup into a blender and puree in batches, or puree using an immersion blender directly in the pot. For a chunkier soup, use a potato masher or fork and mash until desired consistency is achieved.
Serve. Serve with some Parmesan cheese, feta cheese, and a side of breadsticks or Grilled Cheese Roll Ups (if desired).
